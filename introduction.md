# Introduction

XenPay implements the X402 protocol.  

X402 is a web-native payment standard that allows apps and websites to request on-chain stablecoin payments via HTTP “402 Payment Required.”  

XenPay uses this protocol to run a **prediction market** on the Base blockchain, where users connect their wallets and place bets on real-world events. All transactions are recorded on-chain in real time.
